<p>In this book we focus on organizations that build products and services which depend on software. These days, that means almost every organization. In a <em>Forbes</em> article titled &quot;Now Every Company Is A Software Company,&quot; David Zanca, senior vice president for information technology at FedEx, describes himself as running &quot;a software company inside of FedEx.&quot; Venkatesh Prasad, senior technical leader at Ford, describes the company as a maker of &quot;sophisticated computers-on-wheels.&quot;</p>

<p>Many organizations haven't yet grasped the fact that they are -- or will become -- software companies at heart. Many that have realized this don't understand its full implications. Those who ignore it are doomed to failure. Take the case of Nokia. Ben Wood of CCS Insight notest that &quot;Nokia make great phones, they still do. They went through this incredible decade of innovation in hardware, but what Apple saw was that all you needed was a rectangle with a screen, and the rest was all about the software.&quot;&lt;span data-type=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23947212&lt;/span&gt;</p>

<p>This book explains how to grow companies that can innovate sustainably through building products and services based on software.</p>

<p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'</p>
