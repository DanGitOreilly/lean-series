<p>Two related areas form the subject matter of this book. First we discuss how enterprises can create and evolve innovative products and services based on software. Second, we explore the culture of organizations that innovate sustainably. Our goal is to grow organizations whose people can adapt rapidly and continuously to changing market conditions and create value for customers. Thus we can outcompete.</p>

<p>Since the 1970s, most organizations have treated the development of new products and services as if it was a civil engineering project: assemble requirements, start a project that typically takes between six months to several years to complete, and then release. Despite over ten years of agile methodologies and the application of lean principles to software development, many enterprises (and a surprisingly large number of startups) are still following this project-driven approach, and the results are well-known to everybody. Extended periods working overtime followed by painful, high-risk releases. Unhappy customers. The failure of the business to achieve the expected return on investment.</p>

<p>Even where organizations claim to have adopted agile and lean methodologies, many are simply practicing cargo-cult agile. The engineers take orders standing up rather than sitting down. The huge requirements documents that won't be turned into a working product or service for months are now prioritized and estimated. Developers showcase software from workstations to business analysts at the end of month-long sprints in order to get their &quot;story points.&quot; Still, the product or service that is eventually presented to customers takes too long to build, and does not achieve the expected return on investment.</p>

<p>A decade ago, this kind of approach&mdash;while wasteful&mdash;still produced acceptable results. However in the last ten years a number of changes -- such as cloud computing, internet marketing, and the expansion of Asian manufacturing -- have occurred that substantially reduce the capital cost of entering many markets for new products and services. Startups now have the tools to create products and services that only large companies could have built just a few years ago.</p>

<p>This in turn has made it much easier for consumers to access information and services that previously would not have been available online at all, or where possible would have required a significant outlay in software and hardware. 3D printing is already beginning to enable us to treat hardware in the same way we are treat software, which will again revolutionize product development.</p>

<p>The rate of change in technology is increasing, and thus competitive pressure is accelerating. As Deloitte's Shift Index shows, the average life expectancy of a Fortune 500 company has declined from around 75 years half a century ago to less than 15 years today. Professor Richard Foster of Yale University &quot;estimates that by 2020, more than three-quarters of the S&amp;P 500 will be companies that we have not heard of yet.&quot;<span data-type="footnote">This is a footnote. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16611040</span></p>

<p>To compete in today's economy, organizations need software development at the heart of their business. This shift in thinking about IT has even lead to some large companies, including GE and GM, pioneers of outsourcing, taking IT back in house. As reported by <em>The Economist</em>:</p>

<blockquote data-type="epigraph">
<p>GM's reasons for doing this may well apply to many other firms too. &quot;IT has become more pervasive in our business and we now consider it a big source of competitive advantage,&quot; says Randy Mott, GM's chief information officer, who has been responsible for the reversal of the outsourcing strategy. While the work was being done by outsiders, he said most of the resources that GM was devoting to IT were spent on keeping things going as they were rather than on thinking up new ways of doing them. The company reckons that having its IT work done mostly in-house and nearby will give it more flexibility and speed and encourage more innovation.</p>

<p>Management can no longer expect to out-compete if they do not focus on how software-based products and services should be designed, created, and run. Unfortunately, software has some important characteristics which make traditional management methods fundamentally unsuitable for this purpose.</p>

<p>These differences have enormous implications not just for product development, but for operations, and the way we do budgeting and governance. This book explains how to grow your organization to take advantage of lean product development, and the benefits of doing so, providing examples from companies that have learned how to do it right the hard way.</p>

<h1>What This Book Is About</h1>

<p>This book is written for established organizations that want to bring new products and services to market faster, with lower risk, at lower cost. It draws from the movements that represent the second generation of Lean and Agile development: Lean Startup, Lean Product Development, Continuous Delivery, and DevOps. At these heart of these movements are patterns and practices which make it cheap and low risk to work in small batches, and to harness this capability to enable organizations to adapt rapidly to new conditions through business model innovation while driving down costs through continuous improvement.</p>

<p>The patterns and practices we describe are straightforward, but adopting them is difficult because they require that the people working within enterprises change their mindset. Traditionally many organizations have treated IT as a service: something they can either separate out as an internal function independent of their core business, or outsource entirely. This is one way to reduce cost, but leads to enormous waste and inefficiency in getting from business ideas to measurable customer outcomes.</p>

<p>Instead we need to create organizations that are primarily focused on learning what customers want and getting it to them as rapidly as possible. This apparently simple change in focus has enormous implications for every part of the modern enterprise: on organizational structure, systems architecture, how leadership and management are best approached, how we budget and make investment decisions, how we manage delivery, and most importantly on organizational culture.</p>

<p>What is different about this book? We present a uniquely practical guide to the secrets of transforming enterprises so that they can develop new products and services faster and more cheaply. We have written it to address the needs and concerns of management and executives in medium and large companies. While these organizations covet the agility of smaller companies, they are constrained by the inevitable trappings of size: distribution, procurement, risk management, politics, and governance. These concerns often conspire to kill agility. As The Economist Intelligence Unit notes.</p>

<h1>Why Did We Write This Book?</h1>

<p>All of your authors are experienced working in both enterprises and startups, and we have set out to present a pragmatic and systematic approach to delivery that works effectively within the constraints of established companies. We have addressed not just how high performing organizations do product development, but how companies that are working towards higher performance can adopt these techniques in an incremental, low-risk way.</p>

<p>We wrote the book because of our frustration at the state of the industry. The techniques and practices we describe are not new, and they are known to work. But they are still not mainstream. As a result, companies toil at building products and services that do a poor job of serving customer needs. Customers, employees, and ultimately the organizations that build the products suffer as a result of this.</p>

<p>When <em>Continuous Delivery</em> and <em><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026242.do">The Lean Startup</a></em> came out, we saw an enormous amount of demand from people working in enterprises who wanted to adopt the practices described in these books. A large number of companies have achieved measurable benefit from using the practices we discuss: Getting products to market faster with higher customer satisfaction. Higher returns on investment. Reducing costs by not building features that customers don't care about. More frequent, lower risk releases. Happier employees who are no longer working unsustainable hours.</p>

<p>But everybody told us how difficult it was to implement these ideas successfully. In most cases it was impossible to realize the full benefit because only part of the organization changed -- and that part still needed to work with the rest of the organization, which expected them to behave the same way they always had.</p>

<p>For example, if budgets are decided annually, it's very hard to build a large number of minimum viable products and then decide which ones to provide additional funding for based on customer feedback. Another example: continuous delivery provides a superior way to manage risk compared to some traditional IT controls, but requires better collaboration between development and operations -- which auditors might view as violating segregation of duties. There are many other such blockers: architecture, lack of skills, reporting and management processes to name just a few.</p>

<h1>Who Should Read This Book?</h1>

<p>We wrote this book primarily for people who are interested in running or managing projects using lean product development. Thus it's a non-technical book, and one that focuses on principles, practices and patterns.</p>

<p>We have in mind for our audience:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Executives interested in good practices for delivery and good governance.</li>
	<li>Directors of IT, both for applications and for infrastructure and operations.</li>
	<li>Anyone working in program or project management, including members of the PMO.</li>
	<li>People in finance, accounting, or risk management who are involved in delivery.</li>
	<li>Product owners, and others involved in developing products and services that involve software development.</li>
</ul>

<p>Practitioners working on delivery teams may also find this book interesting, although it doesn't discuss engineering practices such as how to write maintainable functional acceptance tests, build and deployment automation, managing infrastructure and databases, and configuration management.</p>

<h1>Conspectus</h1>

<p>In <a data-type="xref" href="#chapter01">Chapter 1, Towards the Lean Enterprise</a>, we discuss characteristics of many organizations that lead to failed IT projects, and present the principles behind successful innovation at scale. You'll learn why traditional approaches to the development of new products and services are problematic, discover the ``three ways'' (the principles behind the rest of the book) and get an overview of the cultural forces that enable innovation at scale.</p>

<p>Chapter 2, ``The Innovative Organization'', discusses the importance of organizational culture to delivering innovative products and services. We'll explore the problems with traditional productivity measures, and explain how to create a scalable innovation culture. We'll consider the relationship between an organization's culture and its attitude to risk, and share a practical approach to changing organizational culture.</p>

<p>Chapter 3, ``Managing Your Innovation Portfolio'', covers how portfolio management, budgeting, and accounting work in the world of lean product development. You'll learn how to budget for rapid innovation, and how to manage -- and balance -- a portfolio of existing services along with new products transparently using real-time economic data rather than centralized planning and projects.</p>

<p>Chapter 4, ``Discovering Value'', begins with the importance of identifying and understanding your customer, and producing and evolving a minimum viable product to test your business case as rapidly as possible based on real feedback. You'll learn how to practice business model innovation, how to measure the value delivered by your products, and practices for getting rapid customer feedback on your product ideas.</p>

<p>Chapter 5, ``Grow and Scale'', addresses how to deal with scaling products and services and the organizations that build and run them. We show how to do program management at scale, as well as discussing how to grow capability and drive down costs through continuous process innovation. Finally we discuss a strategy for scaling IT operations.</p>

<p>Chapter 6, ``Technical Practices and Architecture'', shows how to build out the technical capability to learn from users as rapidly as possible in order to delight them using continuous delivery. You'll learn how to create feedback loops at multiple points, patterns for low-risk, incremental releases, and how to incrementally evolve your enterprise architecture.</p>

<p>Chapter 7, ``Lean Governance, Risk and Compliance'', discusses the problems with traditional approaches to GRC, and sets out the principles behind a lightweight approach based on lean thinking. In this chapter you'll learn how to use lean startup and continuous delivery to better achieve governance goals, and how to effectively deal with risk and compliance issues. This Is an A-Head Congratulations on starting your new project! We've added some skeleton files for you, to help you get started, but you can delete any or all of them, as you like. In the file called chapter.html, we've added some placeholder content showing you how to markup and use some basic book elements, like notes, sidebars, and figures.</p>
