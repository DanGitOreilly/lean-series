<p>Two related areas form the subject matter of this book. First we discuss how enterprises can create and evolve innovative products and services based on software. Second, we explore the culture of organizations that innovate sustainably. Our goal is to grow organizations whose people can adapt rapidly and continuously to changing market conditions and create value for customers. Thus we can outcompete.</p>

<p>Since the 1970s, most organizations have treated the development of new products and services as if it was a civil engineering project: assemble requirements, start a project that typically takes between six months to several years to complete, and then release. Despite over ten years of agile methodologies and the application of lean principles to software development, many enterprises (and a surprisingly large number of startups) are still following this project-driven approach, and the results are well-known to everybody. Extended periods working overtime followed by painful, high-risk releases. Unhappy customers. The failure of the business to achieve the expected return on investment.</p>

<p>Even where organizations claim to have adopted agile and lean methodologies, many are simply practicing cargo-cult agile. The engineers take orders standing up rather than sitting down. The huge requirements documents that won't be turned into a working product or service for months are now prioritized and estimated. Developers showcase software from workstations to business analysts at the end of month-long sprints in order to get their &quot;story points.&quot; Still, the product or service that is eventually presented to customers takes too long to build, and does not achieve the expected return on investment.</p>

<p>A decade ago, this kind of approach -- while wasteful -- still produced acceptable results. However in the last ten years a number of changes -- such as cloud computing, internet marketing, and the expansion of Asian manufacturing -- have occurred that substantially reduce the capital cost of entering many markets for new products and services. Startups now have the tools to create products and services that only large companies could have built just a few years ago.</p>

<p>This in turn has made it much easier for consumers to access information and services that previously would not have been available online at all, or where possible would have required a significant outlay in software and hardware. 3D printing is already beginning to enable us to treat hardware in the same way we are treat software, which will again revolutionize product development.</p>

<p>The rate of change in technology is increasing, and thus competitive pressure is accelerating. As Deloitte's Shift Index shows, the average life expectancy of a Fortune 500 company has declined from around 75 years half a century ago to less than 15 years today. Professor Richard Foster of Yale University ``estimates that by 2020, more than three-quarters of the S&amp;P 500 will be companies that we have not heard of yet.<span data-type="footnote">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16611040</span></p>

<p>To compete in today's economy, organizations need software development at the heart of their business. This shift in thinking about IT has even lead to some large companies, including GE and GM, pioneers of outsourcing, taking IT back in house. As reported by <em>The Economist</em>:</p>

<blockquote data-type="epigraph">
<p>GM's reasons for doing this may well apply to many other firms too. ``IT has become more pervasive in our business and we now consider it a big source of competitive advantage,'' says Randy Mott, GM's chief information officer, who has been responsible for the reversal of the outsourcing strategy. While the work was being done by outsiders, he said most of the resources that GM was devoting to IT were spent on keeping things going as they were rather than on thinking up new ways of doing them. The company reckons that having its IT work done mostly in-house and nearby will give it more flexibility and speed and encourage more innovation.</p>

<p>Management can no longer expect to out-compete if they do not focus on how software-based products and services should be designed, created, and run. Unfortunately, software has some important characteristics which make traditional management methods fundamentally unsuitable for this purpose.</p>

<p>These differences have enormous implications not just for product development, but for operations, and the way we do budgeting and governance. This book explains how to grow your organization to take advantage of lean product development, and the benefits of doing so, providing examples from companies that have learned how to do it right the hard way.</p>
