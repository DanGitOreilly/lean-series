== From Scattered to Scatterplot

You found it! These are the code examples we’ll be working through during the workshop. All of these examples (including a handy cheat sheet) are also posted https://github.com/alignedleft/scattered-scatterplot[on GitHub], so you can download and run them locally.

I will be using Chrome to walk through these examples during the workshop. You may want to also view this with Chrome, to follow along. (Due to a glitch, some verisons of Safari don’t display anything in the output panels below. If you’re having trouble with Safari, please switch to Chrome.)
